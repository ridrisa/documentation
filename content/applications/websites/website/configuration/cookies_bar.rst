**Cookies** are small text files sent to your device when you visit a website. They are processed
and stored by your browser and track user information like login details, preferences, and browsing
history. **Essential cookies** are necessary for the website to function, while **optional cookies**
analyze behavior or display ads.

Data protection laws require notifying users about data collection methods and purposes.
**Cookie bars** fulfill this obligation by informing users on their first visit and allowing them to
decide whether to store optional cookies on their devices.

Configuration
=============

To enable the cookies bar on your website, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration -->
Settings` and enable :guilabel:`Cookies Bar` in the :guilabel:`Privacy` section.

.. note::
   The :ref:`Cookie Policy <cookies-bar/policy>` page (/cookie-policy) is automatically created when
   you enable the cookies bar.

Customization
=============

From your website, click :guilabel:`Edit`, go to the :guilabel:`Invisible Elements` section at the

the :guilabel:`Size` of the cookie bar, and enable :guilabel:`Backdrop` to gray out the page in the
background when the cookies bar is displayed on the screen.

Click anywhere in the building block to further customize the appearance of the cookies bar using
:guilabel:`Block`, :guilabel:`Column` and/or :guilabel:`Inline Text` customization options.
